# tick-tack-toe
Tick-tack-toe game in React JS.

There are two game modes to choose from:
- player vs player
- player vs computer

In player vs computer, the computer is not unbeatable (i.e Minmax algorithm, where you can't win, only lose or draw).
There is some randomness with moves that are not game-ending (win/lose). Have fun figuring out the moves to win ;)

Stack used:
- React JS with Hooks to manage state
- Higher order components
- React Router
- Styled Components
- Typechecking with Proptypes
